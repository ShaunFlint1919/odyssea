Since we don't have ZIP tools in this environment, you can:

1. **Download the entire `wordpress-plugin` folder** from Replit to your computer
2. **Create a ZIP file on your computer:**
   - **On Mac:** Right-click the folder → Compress "wordpress-plugin"
   - **On Windows:** Right-click the folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder

4. Rename it to: `odyssea-lymphea`

### Option 3: Use the TAR.GZ (Already Created)

I've created `odyssea-lymphea-plugin.tar.gz` (4.2MB) for you:
