SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER

To add a theme screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your homepage (1200x900px recommended)
2. Save it as "screenshot.png" in this directory
3. This image will appear in WordPress Admin → Appearance → Themes

The screenshot helps users preview the theme before activating it.

For now, WordPress will display a default placeholder.
